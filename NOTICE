## PHP OPC UA Client Library

Copyright (c) 2025 TechDock

This library is licensed under the MIT License. See LICENSE file for details.

## Source Attribution

**This library is a PHP implementation of OPC UA client functionality based on the architecture and design of the OPC Foundation UA-.NETStandard implementation.**

### Original Implementation

This PHP client library is inspired by and based on the architecture of the C#/.NET implementation:

- **Project**: OPC Foundation UA-.NETStandard
- **Repository**: https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard
- **Copyright**: OPC Foundation
- **License**: Dual-license model
  - RCL (Reference Code License) for OPC Foundation Corporate Members
  - GPL 2.0 for non-members
- **License Information**: https://opcfoundation.org/license/source/1.11/index.html

### This PHP Implementation

This PHP library:
- Is an independent implementation of OPC UA client functionality
- Follows the same architectural patterns as UA-.NETStandard
- Maintains 100% wire-protocol compatibility with the OPC UA specification
- Adapts the design to PHP 8.4+ idioms and type system
- Focuses on client-only features (no server implementation)
- Is approximately 35-40% the code volume of the .NET core stack

**Implementation Approach:**
- Hand-written message classes (not code-generated)
- Modern PHP features (readonly classes, union types, match expressions)
- Client-focused: Browse, Read, Write, Subscribe, Call, Historical data
- Independent work licensed under MIT License

While this is an independent implementation, we acknowledge that the architectural design, service structure, and implementation patterns are directly inspired by the excellent UA-.NETStandard project.

**We are deeply grateful to the OPC Foundation and all UA-.NETStandard contributors for their outstanding reference implementation that informed this work.**
